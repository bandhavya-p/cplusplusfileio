About program: 
This program uses three different functions that (1) capitalize, (2) lowercase, (3) remove punctuations. The program then uses int main() to obtain the name of an input file and proceeds to ask which option the user would like to apply to each line in the input file. It then applies said options through a switch statement and then transfers these new lines to an output.txt file and closes both the input and output.
