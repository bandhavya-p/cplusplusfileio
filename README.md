About program: 
This program uses command-line arguments and creates an array based on the array size that is given through the command-line arguments and prompts the user for that number of integers. Once the user gives the desired integer values, the program prints out the original array elements, the sum of the array elements, the maximum integer, the minimum integer, as well as the array reversed.
