About program: 
This program uses int main(int argc, char*argv[]) to obtain the name of an output file through command line arguments. It then asks the user for the name of the input file and uses two if statements to check if the file exists. The program uses a while statement that has a nested for-loop and uses functions to check whether there are characters and if they are lower or upper case and switches the capitalization. The inverse capitalization is then sent to the output file and the files are then closed and it lets the user know that it is complete.
